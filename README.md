The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for this project are:

1. `popup.html`: This is the HTML file that will be displayed when the user clicks on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar. It will contain the structure of the popup and the elements where the SEO values will be displayed.

2. `popup.js`: This JavaScript file will contain the logic for extracting the SEO values from the current page and updating the popup with these values. It will also contain the logic for determining if the SEO values follow best practices.

3. `popup.css`: This CSS file will contain the styles for the popup. It will define the appearance of the popup and the green and red circle icons.

4. `manifest.json`: This JSON file will define the basic properties of the extension, such as its name, version, and permissions. It will also specify the files to be used for the popup and the background script.

Now, let's write the content of each file.

`manifest.json`
